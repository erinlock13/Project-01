- Required - (15 points) - 

- At least eight knots: first eight knots are on lines 16, 19, 22, 46, 57, 68, 83, 94. Not going to list the rest but you're free to see them yourself. 

- Major choice: There are a few, but I'll list my favorite. When day==3, the player is allowed to explore the grounds and they can choose to escape via the boat (line 225) or can escape using the bridge (line 236) or they can go straight to the tree (line 253) or can go through the sinkhole (line 212), all of which produce different endings. In total, there are 8 different endings. 

- A loop: At various points, you can ask a character if they're alright over and over again (line 105)

- Extras - (5 points) -

- There is a lot of extra content so I'll just record what's listed on Canvas for extra.

- More than eight knots: I've think I counted around 67 knots so....

- Players can pick up objects: Players can pick up a rifle, a booklet, and a fishing rod which will add to their stats (line 138). If their stats are already high, the description will say it is useless.

- Stats: The player chooses between 3 different characters. Each character has unique stats that change the course of the game including the ending. The items can temporarily upgrade these stats. There are also "tokens" that can be acquired if the player has the required stats. 

- Keep track of visited places: While some places have this (sinkhole, line 200) there is also a day variable that changes when the day ends. When a new day begins, new descriptions are shown in these places. Some interactions are only available on certain days as well.
